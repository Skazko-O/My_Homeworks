            <p>React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React
              and the app platform‚Äôs native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your
              platform‚Äôs APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React
              components: <span class="italic">bundles of reusable, nestable code</span>. You can learn more about
              React
              in
              the next
              section. But first, let‚Äôs cover how components work in React Native.

              React Native runs on <u>React</u>, a popular open source library for building user interfaces with
              JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section
              can get you started or can serve as a refresher course.
            </p>

            <p>
              We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>+ components.</b> The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its examples: friendly,
              approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>+ JSX.</b> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements inside JavaScript
              like so:<br> <span class="text-code">&lt;Text&gt; Hello, I am your cat! &lt;/Text&gt;</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The React docs have <u>a comprehensive guide to JSX</u> you can refer to learn even more. Because JSX is
              JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a <span class="text-code">name</span>
              for
              the cat, name,
              and embedding it with curly braces inside <span class="text-code">&lt;Text&gt;</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>+ props.</b> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>+ state.</b> While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure how components render,
              state is like a component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that
              changes over time or that comes from user interaction. State gives your components memory!
            </p>

          <hr class="divider">
          <div class="chapter">
            <p id="handling">handling text input</p>
            <sup>Chapter 4</sup>
          </div>
          <div class="main_text">
            <p>
              TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an <span
                class="italic">onChangeText</span> prop that
              takes a function to be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a
              function to be called when the text is submitted.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a different
              language. In this new language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence
              "Hello there Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".
